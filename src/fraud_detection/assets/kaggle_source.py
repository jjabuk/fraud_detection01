    this is meant to be materialized by hand, rarely, whenever the staged
    GCS file needs (re)seeding -- not re-run on every ingestion pass. See
    README for the one-time flip of RawCsvSourceResource.uri once this has
    been materialized at least once.

    Downloads to a temp dir and streams that file straight to GCS -- at no
